  KeyboardShortcut
  ================

  This module revolves around the KeyboardShortcut custom type which can be
  either a `Sequence` or a `Chord`.

  A `Sequence` is for keyboard shortcuts that either need just a single key to
  trigger— in which case the last key in the Sequence is all that's required to
  check— or a multiple key presses (limited to 2) done within a short time
  span of each other, much like how the <leader> shortcut sequences work in
  the Vim editor. Keystrokes are recorded in KeyboardShortcut.Model.
  The `fromKeyboardEvent` helper creates a `Sequence` (when it doesn't match a
  `Chord`) using the last 2 presses made. If there was only, 1 keypress, it's a
  `Sequence` of 1.

  A `Chord` is for combination keyboard shortcuts like CMD+k where the user
  presses a key while holding a modifier.  `fromKeyboardEvent` creates `Chord`
  over `Sequence` when a modifier is held.

  TEA
  ---

  To use this module, attach `KeyboardShortcut.Model`, `KeyboardShortcut.init`,
  `KeyboardShortcut.Msg`, and `KeyboardShortcut.update` in the parent as often
  seen in TEA composition.  Collect keystrokes from the parents keyboard event
  handlers wity `KeyboardShortcut.collect`

  `KeyboardShortcut.view` render shortcut indicators to provide the user with
  instruction on how a shortcut can be performed. If viewing a `Sequence`
  shortcut, the key that initiates the sequence will be highlighted when
  pressed.
